# Linked-Lists-Kth

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

### kth from end

- argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
- Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

### Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

- Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
- Where k and the length of the list are the same
- Where k is not a positive integer
- Where the linked list is of a size 1
- “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Worked with Jeffrey Smith and Alfredo Orquiz to write the code.

Run [npm test code-challenge06] to run tests.
